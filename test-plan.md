Test plan
===

Travis CI and Jenkins are used to run the tests automatically after every push to Github.
Each Pull Request is also tested and flagged with the result. 
If a commit causes a failure we will be notified by email or Telegram (Instant Messaging).

To have an overview of how much code is tested by the test code coverage tools are used. For example lcov is used to generate the code coverage using GCC.
Code coverage is generated on Travis and stored on [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/LEDfan/Bachelorproef).

# Unit

Using the Google Test and Google Mock frameworks the individual units of the program will be tested. 
The difference with scenario tests is that only one unit is tested at a time.

Given that at the time of writing the design for gen-geo isn't entirely finished, the test plan should not be considered completely accurate.
By using white-box testing the internal structure of the code can be studied, allowing us to more easily identify edge cases (e.g. character escaping in the input format, missing keys ...).
The same holds for the `GeoGridReader` and `GeoGridWriter` classes.

The main datastructure classes (`Location`, `GeoGrid`, `ContactCenter`, `ContactPool` and `Cluster`) are rather easy to test because they only have a few simple methods.
The tests of the `School`, `HighSchool`, `Workplace`, `Household` are trivial since they only implement some simple acccesor methods.
Generating the GeoGrid is done by the `GeoGridGenerator` class. This class contains a list of classes implementing the `IPartialGenerator` interface.

In comparison with one `GeoGridGenerator` this design is easier to test. The different sub-parts of the GeoGrid are generated by different classes, as a result they can easily by tested in isolation.

The algorithm used in the `GeoGridGenerator` is very simple: loop over the different generators and execute them, hence it's easy to test it.

## Input and output
### CSV Reader
Functionality: The Cities, Commuting and Household reader converts an input csv file to the internal data structure.
Test Method: This will be tested by giving a specific input file. We will then run the reader on the file and then check if the returned object has the correct values. For example the amount of cities returned, the name, id and province of the read cities etc.

### GeoGrid JSON Writer
Functionality: The GeoGrid Reader converts a generated GeoGrid to a JSON file. This can be done after the GeoGrid or population was generated, since they use the same internal data structure.
The resulting output should contain all information in the GeoGrid so it can be converted to a GeoGrid again by the GeoGrid reader without any difference.
Test Method: Manually construct a GeoGrid and compare the resulting JSON with the expected values. This should test all possible types of values, like for example a Household, School, Workplace, etc, but also with and without people in the corresponding ContactCenter.
### GeoGrid JSON Reader
Functionality: Convert a JSON file containing the necessary information to a valid GeoGrid.
Test Method: Construct manual JSON input files and compare the generated GeoGrid to the expected values. The criteria for building good GeoGrids for testing is analogous to the GeoGrid Writer.
## Logic
### Generators
Functionality: Given a GeoGrid, add Schools, Workplaces and Communities to Locations based on a probabilistic method as described in the assignment.
Test Method: Given a specific GeoGrid, check if the decorated GeoGrid by the Generator is the same as expected. As the generator uses a probabilistic method, the testing wil need to be done using a fixed seed for the tests or it could compare the output to reasonable bounds. 

### Populators
List of populators:
 - HouseholdPopulator
 - StudentPopulator
 - SchoolPopulator
 - WorkplacePopulator
 - CommunityPopulator

Functionality: These are all implemented as a partial populator and thus can apply their functionality on the passed GeoGrid.
Test Method: This similarity also means the testing method can be quite similar. For each populator, we construct a set of GeoGrids which have certain characteristics to reliably test certain corresponding functionality. Since these methods are also probabilistic in nature, we have to apply a similar comparison method to the one used in the Generator tests.

# Scenario
The outcome of the complete Simulator is tested by a [Scenario Test](https://github.com/LEDfan/Bachelorproef/blob/master/test/cpp/gtester/BatchRuns.cpp), more information can be found in [Bounds Research](bounds.md) and [Paper](week3/main/paper.pdf).

The GeoGrid Generator must also be tested by scenario tests. 
By splitting up the generator into subparts the influence of the different parts on the outcome of the GeoGenerator can be compared and verified. 
The scenario tests can also be splitted into the different parts.
A similar research as for the BatchRuns can be done in order to determine the acceptable values.

The Python interface is currently tested by a [simple smoke test](https://github.com/LEDfan/Bachelorproef/blob/master/test/python/testSimple.py). 
It doesn't cover all parts of the interface but any compile or link error will be discovered.

As the design is subject to change when it is implemented. We do not know perfectly what tests will be made exactly. So this test plan inventory may be expanded in the future.

## GeoGrid JSON Reader and Writer
Functionality: same as the combination of the individual components, but we have to make sure they can work together.
Test Method: Create a manual GeoGrid, convert it to JSON by using the GeoGrid writer and parse this again in the GeoGrid reader. We can then compare this to the original GeoGrid, which should be the identical.

## Reader Factory
Functionality: The factory must return a reader that gives the correct output given a specific input file.
Test Method: We test the reader factory by asking to create a reader for a file. We then check if the output of the reader is as expected.

## Complete pipeline / GeoGridGenerator
Functionality: The complete functionality of the GeoGen.
Test Method:
 - Give the program specific cities, commutes and household input files. And then check that GeoGrid is generated from this. This also has the extra difficulty of being probabilistic, so bounds need to be used. 
 - We will also test the extreme cases. These are cases where the input is limited so we know what the output will be. For example one city with enough population so there will be at least 1 school generated in the city.
