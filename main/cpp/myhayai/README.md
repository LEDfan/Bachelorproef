Hayai was originally created in 2011 by Nick Bruun <nick@bruun.co>
and a number of other collaborators (cfr. the github website for hayai).

In 2018 by Jan Broeckhove et. al. used it as a starting point and redesigned
and recoded the framework and shifted the focus from micro- to macro-benchmarking.

* Complete redesign and recoding using C++11/14 constructs whenver useful. You'll notice I'm fond of functors and of boost's propert tree.
* Doing away with all macro usage. I am not fond of macros and also, more importantly, I wanted a programmable, flexible framework. 

Being able to start fron the hayai framework helped me along quite a bit in the development. Also, copyright-wise, I think the original copyright still apllies
so I added it in this directory.
